1
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:19,974
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,309
Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:15,947
We made it.

4
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:20,994
I guess I was wrong.

5
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:23,413
There was no danger at all.

6
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:43,975
Cordé.

7
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:48,104
Milady, I'm so sorry.

8
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:51,482
I've failed you, Senator.

9
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:52,567
No.

10
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,406
Milady, you're still in danger here.

11
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:07,999
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

12
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,753
You did your duty. Cordé did hers.
Now, come.

13
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:15,840
Senator Amidala, please.

14
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:31,064
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

15
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:33,983
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

16
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:37,779
- If they do break away...
- I will not let this Republic

17
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:41,491
that has stood for a thousand years
be split in two.

18
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:44,827
My negotiations will not fail.

19
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,037
If they do,

20
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,457
you must realise there aren't enough
Jedi to protect the Republic.

21
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,960
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

22
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:57,090
Master Yoda.

23
00:04:57,173 --> 00:05:00,009
Do you think it will really come to war?

24
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,723
The dark side clouds everything.

25
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:10,603
Impossible to see the future is.

26
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,193
Good.

27
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,656
Send them in.

28
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:24,450
We will discuss this matter later.

29
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:32,750
Senator Amidala,
your tragedy on the landing platform,

30
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,794
terrible.

31
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:38,548
Seeing you alive
brings warm feelings to my heart.

32
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:41,426
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

33
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:46,222
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

34
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:49,058
I think that Count Dooku was behind it.

35
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:53,062
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

36
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:56,023
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

37
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:59,777
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

38
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,363
But for certain, Senator,

39
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:07,326
in grave danger you are.

40
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,455
Master Jedi, may I suggest

41
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:14,667
the senator be placed
under the protection of your graces.

42
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,920
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

43
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:20,131
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe...

44
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,842
The situation is that serious?

45
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:25,178
No, but I do, Senator.

46
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:28,514
I realise all too well
that additional security

47
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,850
might be disruptive for you,

48
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:34,937
but perhaps someone
you're familiar with.

49
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:39,108
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

50
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,319
That's possible.

51
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:44,197
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

52
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,533
Do it for me, milady. Please?

53
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:50,161
The thought of losing you...

54
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:53,831
Is unbearable.

55
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,960
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

56
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:00,421
Thank you, Master Windu.

57
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:11,682
You seem a little on edge.

58
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,226
Not at all.

59
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:16,354
I haven't felt you this tense since
we fell into that nest of gundarks.

60
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:19,440
You fell into that nightmare,
Master,

61
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:22,151
and I rescued you, remember?

62
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:23,945
Oh.

63
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:26,322
Yes.

64
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:34,288
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

65
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,291
I haven't seen her in ten years, Master.

66
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,725
Obi? Obi!

67
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:57,061
Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!

68
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,771
Good to see you again, Jar Jar.

69
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,648
Senator Padmé.

70
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:04,277
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.

71
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:07,029
Desa Jedi arriven.

72
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,828
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

73
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,330
It has been far too long, Master Kenobi.

74
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:21,085
Ani? My goodness, you've grown.

75
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:25,214
So have you.
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

76
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,842
Well, for a senator, I mean.

77
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:33,347
Ani, you'll always be
that little boy I knew on Tatooine.

78
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,269
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

79
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,771
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

80
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:43,316
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

81
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,192
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

82
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:48,195
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

83
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,115
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

84
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,367
I want to know who's trying to kill me.

85
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:57,163
We are here to protect you, Senator,
not to start an investigation.

86
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,915
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

87
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,375
I promise you.

88
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,629
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

89
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,673
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

90
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:10,217
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin,

91
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:13,054
- and you will pay attention to my lead.
- Why?

92
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,513
What?

93
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,225
Why else do you think
we were assigned to her

94
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:20,186
if not to find the killer?

95
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,356
Protection is a job for local security,
not Jedi.

96
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:26,484
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

97
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,945
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

98
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,284
And you will learn your place,
young one.

99
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,790
Perhaps with merely your presence

100
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,959
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

101
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:46,587
Now, if you'll excuse me,

102
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:48,673
I will retire.

103
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,967
I know I'll feel better having you here.

104
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:53,678
I'll have an officer
stationed on every floor,

105
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:56,639
and I'll be in the
control centre downstairs.

106
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:01,227
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

107
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,355
She hardly even recognised me,
Jar Jar.

108
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:10,069
I've thought about her
every day since we parted, and...

109
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,238
She's forgotten me completely.

110
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:16,409
Shesa happy. Happier den mesa
seein her in a longo time.

111
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:21,163
You're focusing on the negative,
Anakin. Be mindful of your thoughts.

112
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:23,082
She was pleased to see us.

113
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,626
Now, let's check the security.

114
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:36,262
I hit the ship, but they used a decoy.

115
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,806
We'll have to try
something more subtle this time, Zam.

116
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,975
My client is getting impatient.
Take these.

117
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,936
Be careful. They're very poisonous.

118
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:47,898
Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

119
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:53,070
Captain Typho has more
than enough men downstairs.

120
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:55,281
No assassin would try that way.

121
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:58,367
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

122
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,036
I don't like just waiting here

123
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,830
for something to happen to her.

124
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,373
What's going on?

125
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:07,251
She covered the cameras.

126
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,170
I don't think she liked me watching her.

127
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,713
What is she thinking?

128
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:14,300
She programmed R2
to warn us if there is an intruder.

129
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,011
There are many other ways
to kill a senator.

130
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,474
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?

131
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:25,603
You're using her as bait.

132
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,938
It was her idea.

133
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:30,316
Don't worry. No harm will come to her.

134
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,819
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

135
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:35,529
Trust me.

136
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:38,157
It's too risky.

137
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,952
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.

138
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:44,121
And yours are?

139
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:48,167
Possibly.

140
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,557
You look tired.

141
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,144
I don't sleep well anymore.

142
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,730
Because of your mother?

143
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:17,696
I don't know why
I keep dreaming about her.

144
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:22,535
Dreams pass in time.

145
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,455
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.

146
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:30,459
Just being around her again
is intoxicating.

147
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:33,504
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

148
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,422
You've made a commitment
to the Jedi order,

149
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,675
a commitment not easily broken.

150
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,928
And don't forget, she's a politician,
and they're not to be trusted.

151
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,472
She's not like the others
in the Senate, Master.

152
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:45,224
It is my experience
that senators

153
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:49,353
focus only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns,

154
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,565
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy

155
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:55,401
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

156
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,988
At least not on the
economics of politics.

157
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,629
And besides, you're generalising.

158
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:59,173
The chancellor
doesn't appear to be corrupt.

159
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,591
Palpatine is a politician.

160
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,010
I have observed that he is very clever

161
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:07,640
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.

162
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,516
I think he's a good man. My...

163
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,644
I sense it too.

164
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,745
Stay here!

165
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,042
Are you all right, milady?

166
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:10,995
What the...

167
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,652
- What took you so long?
- You know, Master.

168
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,613
I couldn't find a speeder
that I really liked.

169
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:28,739
There he is.

170
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,700
With the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.

171
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:33,786
If you spent as much time practicing
your sabre techniques

172
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:36,663
as you do your wit, you would rival
Master Yoda as a swordsman.

173
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,165
I thought I already did.

174
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,834
Only in your mind,
my very young apprentice.

175
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,782
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

176
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,833
You know I don't like it
when you do that.

177
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:21,959
Sorry, Master.

178
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,545
I forgot you don't like flying.

179
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,464
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide.

180
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,871
Anakin!
How many times have I told you...

181
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,873
Stay away from power couplings!

182
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:04,960
That was good!

183
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,728
Where are you going?
He went that way.

184
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,938
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer,

185
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:27,065
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried,

186
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,067
and, personally,
I'd very much like to find out

187
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,570
who he is and who he's working for.

188
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,531
This is a shortcut. I think.

189
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,519
Well, you've lost him.

190
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,605
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

191
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,607
That was some shortcut, Anakin.

192
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,776
He went completely the other way.

193
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,445
- Once again you've proved...
- If you'll excuse me.

194
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:17,658
I hate it when he does that.

195
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:48,975
Anakin!

196
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:52,396
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

197
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,398
Use the Force. Think.

198
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,317
- Sorry, Master.
- He went in there to hide, not to run.

199
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:00,862
- Yes, Master.
- Next time, try not to lose it.

200
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:03,365
- Yes, Master.
- This weapon is your life.

201
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,867
I try, Master.

202
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:08,370
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

203
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,330
Don't say that, Master.

204
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:12,499
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.

205
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:16,086
- Then why don't you listen to me?
- I am trying.

206
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:32,269
- Can you see him?
- I think he is a she,

207
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,187
and I think she is a changeling.

208
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,150
In that case, be extra careful.

209
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,821
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

210
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,281
For a drink.

211
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,418
Thank you.

212
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,254
You wanna buy some death sticks?

213
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,131
You don't want to sell me death sticks.

214
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,966
I don't want to sell you death sticks.

215
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,509
You want to go home
and rethink your life.

216
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:07,179
I want to go home and rethink my life.

217
00:23:55,936 --> 00:24:00,315
Easy. Jedi business.
Go back to your drinks.

218
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:08,281
Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?

219
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:10,909
It was a senator from Naboo.

220
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:12,911
And who hired you?

221
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:13,995
It was just a job.

222
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:17,207
Who hired you? Tell us.

223
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,835
Tell us now!

224
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,463
It was a bounty hunter called...

225
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,693
Toxic dart.

226
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:59,165
Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.

227
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:02,794
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

228
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,504
What about Senator Amidala?

229
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:06,881
She will still need protecting.

230
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:10,343
Handle that your Padawan will.

231
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,140
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

232
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:19,060
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

233
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:21,271
Travel as refugees.

234
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:23,773
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult

235
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:26,610
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.

236
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,322
Until caught this killer is,

237
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:33,783
our judgment she must respect.

238
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:36,244
Anakin, go to the Senate

239
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:39,331
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

240
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:53,345
I will talk with her. Senator Amidala
will not refuse an executive order.

241
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:55,805
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

242
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:58,099
Thank you, Your Excellency.

243
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:02,312
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

244
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:04,481
Your patience has paid off.

245
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:08,151
Your guidance more than my patience.

246
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:11,321
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

247
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:15,075
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

248
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,870
Then you will be invincible.

249
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:24,125
I have said it many times.

250
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,961
You are the most
gifted Jedi I have ever met.

251
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:28,380
Thank you, Your Excellency.

252
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:32,175
I see you becoming
the greatest of all the Jedi, Anakin,

253
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:35,178
even more powerful than Master Yoda.

254
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:42,268
I am concerned for my Padawan.

255
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:45,105
He is not ready to be
given this assignment on his own yet.

256
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:48,191
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

257
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,235
The boy has exceptional skills.

258
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:53,029
But he still has much to learn, Master.

259
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:56,574
His abilities have made him,
well, arrogant.

260
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,702
Yes, yes.

261
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,913
A flaw more and more common
among Jedi.

262
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,456
Hmm.

263
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,418
Too sure of themselves they are.

264
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:09,921
Even the older, more experienced ones.

265
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:13,508
Remember, Obi-Wan,
if the prophecy is true,

266
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,926
your apprentice is the only one

267
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,470
who can bring the Force
back into balance.

268
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:24,144
I'm taking an extended
leave of absence.

269
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:27,439
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the Senate.

270
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:29,315
- Representative Binks...
- Hmm?

271
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:30,442
I know I can count on you.

272
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:35,363
Mesa honoured to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

273
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:39,743
Mesa accept this
with muy, muy humility and...

274
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:42,829
Jar Jar, I don't wish to hold you up.

275
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,414
I'm sure you have a great deal to do.

276
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,834
Of course. Milady.

277
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,841
I do not like this idea of hiding.

278
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,843
Don't worry.

279
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,970
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation,

280
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:01,681
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

281
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:04,851
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act

282
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:07,270
to not be here when its fate is decided.

283
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:11,316
Sometimes we must let go of our pride
and do what is requested of us.

284
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:14,944
Anakin, you've grown up.

285
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:19,449
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it.

286
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:30,418
Don't get me wrong.
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

287
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:35,298
As wise as Master Yoda
and as powerful as Master Windu.

288
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:40,094
I am truly thankful
to be his apprentice.

289
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:45,850
In some ways, a lot of ways,

290
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,145
I'm really ahead of him.

291
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,815
I'm ready for the trials,

292
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:55,527
but he feels that I'm too unpredictable.

293
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,570
He won't let me move on.

294
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:00,406
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

295
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,326
He's overly critical. He never listens.

296
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,537
He doesn't understand.

297
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,164
It's not fair!

298
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:13,169
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

299
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,255
It's the only way we grow.

300
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:19,592
I know.

301
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:22,178
Anakin.

302
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,432
Don't try to grow up too fast.

303
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:29,018
But I am grown up.

304
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:32,981
You said it yourself.

305
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,067
Please don't look at me like that.

306
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:40,613
- Why not?
- It makes me feel uncomfortable.

307
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,868
Sorry, milady.

308
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,677
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

309
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,847
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

310
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:08,266
He'll be safe with me.

311
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:15,565
- You'll be fine.
- It's not me, milady.

312
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:19,736
I worry about you. What if they realise
you've left the capital?

313
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:24,365
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

314
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:26,075
Anakin.

315
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,537
Don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

316
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:31,789
Yes, Master.

317
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,418
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

318
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,253
You'll be back here in no time.

319
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,632
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, Master Jedi.

320
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:42,550
- It's time to go.
- I know.

321
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:45,303
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

322
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:47,639
May the Force be with you, Master.

323
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,610
Suddenly I'm afraid.

324
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:04,489
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

325
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:08,368
Don't worry. We have R2 with us.

326
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,627
I do hope he doesn't try
anything foolish.

327
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:21,589
I'd be more concerned
about her doing something than him.

328
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,570
Someone to see ya, honey!

329
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:46,614
Jedi, by the looks of him.

330
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:51,995
- Obi-Wan!
- Hello, Dex.

331
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:54,747
Take a seat. I'll be right with ya.

332
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:00,628
- You wanna cup o' jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

333
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:07,260
Hey, old buddy!

334
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,522
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

335
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,274
You can tell me what this is.

336
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:25,570
Well, whattaya know!

337
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:28,489
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'

338
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:32,243
on Subterrel, beyond the Outer Rim.

339
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,162
Can you tell me where it came from?
Thank you.

340
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:37,415
This baby belongs to them cloners.

341
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:41,669
What you got here
is a Kamino saberdart.

342
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,839
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

343
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:47,925
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

344
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:51,721
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols.

345
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,557
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect

346
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,892
for the difference
between knowledge and...

347
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:59,854
Wisdom.

348
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:03,816
Well, if droids could think, there'd be
none of us here, would there?

349
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,278
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

350
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,280
No, no. It's beyond the Outer Rim.

351
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:14,577
I'd say about 12 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.

352
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,873
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

353
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:24,962
These Kaminoans keep to themselves.

354
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:28,257
They're cloners. Damn good ones too.

355
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:33,221
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.

356
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:34,889
Depends on what, Dex?

357
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:37,767
On how good your manners are...

358
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:42,855
And how big your pocketbook is.

359
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,492
Did you call for assistance?

360
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:55,618
Yes, yes, I did.

361
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,912
Are you having a problem,
Master Kenobi?

362
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:00,998
Yes, I'm looking for
a planetary system called Kamino.

363
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:02,083
Kamino.

364
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,626
It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

365
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:07,755
Kamino.
It's not a system I'm familiar with.

366
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,716
Are you sure you
have the right coordinates?

367
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,594
According to my information,
it should appear in this quadrant here,

368
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:15,847
just south of the Rishi Maze.

369
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:26,149
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for

370
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:27,775
doesn't exist.

371
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:31,612
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

372
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:34,866
If an item does not appear
in our records,

373
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,493
it does not exist.

374
00:34:58,389 --> 00:35:00,975
Hey, you! No droids!

375
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,810
Get outta here!

376
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,569
Thank you, R2.

377
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:15,489
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to the Jedi,

378
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,700
not being able
to visit the places you like

379
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,744
or do the things you like.

380
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,996
Or be with the people that I love.

381
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:24,790
Are you allowed to love?

382
00:35:24,874 --> 00:35:26,834
I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.

383
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:32,840
Attachment is forbidden.

384
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,927
Possession is forbidden.

385
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,889
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love,

386
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:42,475
is central to a Jedi's life.

387
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:49,440
So you might say
that we are encouraged to love.

388
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:54,070
- You've changed so much.
- You haven't changed a bit.

389
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:57,031
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

390
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:13,256
Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.

391
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:17,009
Use your feelings you must.

392
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:23,557
Younglings. Younglings!

393
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:26,227
A visitor we have.

394
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:29,188
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

395
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:32,400
Hello. I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

396
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:36,112
What help can I be, Obi-Wan, hmm?

397
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:39,115
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

398
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:42,410
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

399
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:43,911
Hmm.

400
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:46,706
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

401
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:48,708
How embarrassing.

402
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:51,210
How embarrassing.

403
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,255
Liam, the shades.

404
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:57,133
Gather round the map reader.

405
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,385
Clear your minds

406
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:03,931
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

407
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:08,602
It ought to be here,

408
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:10,062
but it isn't.

409
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:14,025
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

410
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:15,276
Hmm.

411
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,653
Gravity's silhouette remains,

412
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:20,364
but the star and all the planets,

413
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:22,783
disappeared they have.

414
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:24,827
How can this be?

415
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,122
A thought?

416
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:32,501
- Anyone.
- Master?

417
00:37:32,752 --> 00:37:35,546
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

418
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:43,637
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

419
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:48,100
The Padawan is right.

420
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:51,062
Go to the centre of gravity's pull

421
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:55,149
and find your planet you will.

422
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:03,449
The data must have been erased.

423
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:06,660
But, Master Yoda, who could empty
information from the archives?

424
00:38:06,744 --> 00:38:08,245
That's impossible, isn't it?

425
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:11,874
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

426
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:15,878
Only a Jedi could
have erased those files.

427
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:19,840
But who and why, harder to answer.

428
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:24,053
Meditate on this I will.

429
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,663
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected,

430
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:54,500
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

431
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,293
I'm not sure I was ready.

432
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:59,839
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

433
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:01,674
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution

434
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,717
so you could stay in office.

435
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:06,554
I was relieved
when my two terms were up.

436
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:09,932
But when the queen
asked me to serve as senator,

437
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,435
I couldn't refuse her.

438
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:16,272
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

439
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:20,192
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

440
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,576
If the Senate votes
to create an army,

441
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:30,661
I'm sure it's going
to push us into a civil war.

442
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,997
It's unthinkable.

443
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,292
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

444
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:39,044
Do you see any way
through negotiations

445
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:41,088
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

446
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,048
Not if they feel threatened.

447
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:45,259
My guess is they'll turn
to the Trade Federations

448
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:46,760
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

449
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:51,182
It's outrageous, but after four trials
in the Supreme Court,

450
00:39:51,265 --> 00:39:55,186
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

451
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:59,315
I fear the Senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

452
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,652
We must keep our faith in the Republic.

453
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:14,622
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

454
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:17,082
Let's pray that day never comes.

455
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:20,085
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

456
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:23,214
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?

457
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:25,174
Oh, Anakin's not a Jedi yet.

458
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,301
He's still a Padawan learner.
But I was thinking...

459
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:30,012
- Hold on a minute.
- Excuse me.

460
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,431
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

461
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:34,642
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

462
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:38,312
Excuse me.
I'm in charge of security here, milady.

463
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:40,439
And this is my home.
I know it very well.

464
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:41,899
That is why we're here.

465
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:43,651
I think it would be wise

466
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:46,612
if you took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.

467
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:49,698
Sorry, milady.

468
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:55,120
Perfect. It's settled, then.

469
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:12,054
There it is, R4,
right where it should be.

470
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,681
Our missing planet Kamino.

471
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:53,762
Master Jedi.

472
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:57,182
The prime minister is expecting you.

473
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,936
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

474
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:04,189
He is anxious to meet you.

475
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,317
After all these years,

476
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,695
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

477
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:12,281
Now, please, this way.

478
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:27,463
May I present Lama Su,

479
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:30,049
prime minister of Kamino.

480
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:33,719
And this is Master Jedi...

481
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:35,763
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

482
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:39,099
I trust you're going to enjoy your stay.

483
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:42,102
Please.

484
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:46,315
And now to business.

485
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:50,361
You will be delighted
to hear that we are on schedule.

486
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:53,447
200,000 units are ready,

487
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,075
with a million more well on the way.

488
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,161
That's good news.

489
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:02,164
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas

490
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:05,626
that his order will be met on time.

491
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:07,836
I'm sorry. Master...

492
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:13,300
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still
a leading member of the Jedi Council,

493
00:43:13,384 --> 00:43:14,843
is he not?

494
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:18,722
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

495
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:22,726
Oh. I'm so sorry to hear that.

496
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:27,189
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

497
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:30,442
- The army?
- Yes.

498
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:35,614
A clone army, and I must say,
one of the finest we've ever created.

499
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:37,324
Tell me, Prime Minister,

500
00:43:37,408 --> 00:43:40,244
when my master first
contacted you about the army,

501
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:42,496
did he say who it was for?

502
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:44,289
Of course he did.

503
00:43:44,373 --> 00:43:47,376
This army is for the Republic.

504
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:52,464
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

505
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,467
That's why I'm here.

506
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,574
We used to come here
for school retreat.

507
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:22,619
We would swim to that island every day.

508
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:25,497
I love the water.

509
00:44:30,252 --> 00:44:34,256
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us

510
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:37,384
and try to guess
the names of the birds singing.

511
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:42,389
I don't like sand.

512
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:46,769
It's coarse and rough and irritating,

513
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:48,854
and it gets everywhere.

514
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:53,317
Not like here.

515
00:44:54,026 --> 00:44:56,236
Here, everything is soft...

516
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,615
And smooth.

517
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:38,445
No.

518
00:45:39,196 --> 00:45:41,240
I shouldn't have done that.

519
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:44,701
I'm sorry.

520
00:45:58,549 --> 00:46:02,427
- Very impressive.
- I'd hoped you would be pleased.

521
00:46:05,556 --> 00:46:07,808
Clones can think creatively.

522
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:12,396
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

523
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:20,988
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programs.

524
00:46:21,071 --> 00:46:24,825
This group was created
about five years ago.

525
00:46:24,992 --> 00:46:26,994
You mentioned
growth acceleration.

526
00:46:27,077 --> 00:46:28,662
Oh, yes, it's essential.

527
00:46:28,745 --> 00:46:32,082
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

528
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:34,751
Now we can do it in half the time.

529
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:37,546
I see.

530
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:39,548
They are totally obedient,

531
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:42,342
taking any order without question.

532
00:46:42,426 --> 00:46:44,511
We modified their genetic structure

533
00:46:44,595 --> 00:46:47,973
to make them less independent
than the original host.

534
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:50,475
And who was the original host?

535
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:52,769
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

536
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:56,315
And where is this bounty hunter now?

537
00:46:56,398 --> 00:46:58,984
Oh, we keep him here.

538
00:47:00,903 --> 00:47:04,156
Apart from his pay,
which is considerable,

539
00:47:04,406 --> 00:47:06,491
Fett demanded only one thing,

540
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:09,411
an unaltered clone for himself.

541
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,955
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

542
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:14,583
Pure genetic replication.

543
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:17,628
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile

544
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:20,714
and no growth acceleration.

545
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:23,675
I should very much
like to meet this Jango Fett.

546
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:27,554
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

547
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:48,325
Magnificent, aren't they?

548
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:56,500
I don't know.

549
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,752
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

550
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:01,463
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

551
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:03,715
They only work on the weak-minded.

552
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:08,220
All right. I was 12.

553
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:11,640
His name was Palo. We were both
in the Legislative Youth Programme.

554
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:14,559
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

555
00:48:14,643 --> 00:48:17,312
Dark, curly hair. Dreamy eyes.

556
00:48:17,396 --> 00:48:19,731
All right, I get the picture.

557
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:21,650
Whatever happened to him?

558
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:24,695
I went into public service,
he went on to become an artist.

559
00:48:24,778 --> 00:48:26,697
Maybe he was the smart one.

560
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,740
You really don't like politicians,
do you?

561
00:48:28,824 --> 00:48:31,243
I like two or three,

562
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:33,412
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.

563
00:48:37,374 --> 00:48:39,626
I don't think the system works.

564
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:42,504
How would you have it work?

565
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:47,092
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem,

566
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:51,471
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people, and then do it.

567
00:48:51,555 --> 00:48:53,056
That's exactly what we do.

568
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,600
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

569
00:48:56,143 --> 00:48:57,686
Well, then they should be made to.

570
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,604
By whom? Who's gonna make them?

571
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:01,690
- I don't know. Someone.
- You?

572
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,317
- Of course not me.
- But someone.

573
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:06,153
Someone wise.

574
00:49:06,695 --> 00:49:10,032
Sounds an awful lot
like a dictatorship to me.

575
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:14,036
Well, if it works.

576
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,627
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

577
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:25,589
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.

578
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:46,359
Whoa.

579
00:50:04,753 --> 00:50:06,838
Ani! Ani, are you all right?

580
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:46,336
Boba, is your father here?

581
00:50:47,337 --> 00:50:48,421
Yep.

582
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:50,590
May we see him?

583
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:52,509
Sure.

584
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:57,722
Dad, Taun We's here.

585
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:12,737
Jango, welcome back.

586
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:14,990
Was your trip productive?

587
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:17,159
Fairly.

588
00:51:17,242 --> 00:51:20,745
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

589
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:24,082
He's come to check on our progress.

590
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:27,210
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

591
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:30,380
I'm just a simple man
trying to make my way in the universe.

592
00:51:30,797 --> 00:51:34,134
Ever made your way
as far into the interior as Coruscant?

593
00:51:34,968 --> 00:51:37,095
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

594
00:51:38,847 --> 00:51:40,807
Possibly.

595
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:43,560
Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas.

596
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:52,485
Master who?

597
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,615
Sifo-Dyas.

598
00:51:56,698 --> 00:51:59,367
Is he not the Jedi
who hired you for this job?

599
00:52:02,454 --> 00:52:03,997
Never heard of him.

600
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,752
Really?

601
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:13,089
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

602
00:52:13,173 --> 00:52:14,925
Curious.

603
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:20,013
Do you like your army?

604
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:23,892
I look forward to seeing them in action.

605
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:28,688
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

606
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:31,608
Thank you for your time, Jango.

607
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:34,736
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

608
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:55,840
What is it, Dad?

609
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,886
Pack your things. We're leaving.

610
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:08,770
And when I got to them, we went into
aggressive negotiations. Thank you.

611
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:11,439
"Aggressive negotiations"?
What's that?

612
00:53:11,523 --> 00:53:14,609
Well, negotiations with a lightsabre.

613
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:31,251
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

614
00:54:00,697 --> 00:54:03,074
From the moment I met you,

615
00:54:03,158 --> 00:54:05,952
all those years ago,

616
00:54:06,036 --> 00:54:09,331
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

617
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:14,794
And now that I'm with you again,

618
00:54:14,878 --> 00:54:16,921
I'm in agony.

619
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:23,928
The closer I get to you,
the worse it gets.

620
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:26,973
The thought of not being with you,

621
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,018
I can't breathe.

622
00:54:33,563 --> 00:54:38,985
I'm haunted by the kiss
that you should never have given me.

623
00:54:39,069 --> 00:54:41,196
My heart is beating,

624
00:54:41,404 --> 00:54:44,407
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

625
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,037
You are in my very soul,

626
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,206
tormenting me.

627
00:54:53,917 --> 00:54:57,879
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

628
00:55:08,098 --> 00:55:11,976
If you are suffering as much as I am,
please, tell me.

629
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:16,106
I can't.

630
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:19,901
We can't. It's just not possible.

631
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:23,029
Anything is possible, Padmé.
Listen to me.

632
00:55:23,405 --> 00:55:25,448
No, you listen.

633
00:55:25,532 --> 00:55:29,619
We live in a real world.
Come back to it.

634
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:33,123
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm a senator.

635
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,752
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion,

636
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:41,047
it'll take us to a place we cannot go,

637
00:55:41,131 --> 00:55:43,800
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

638
00:55:44,217 --> 00:55:45,844
Then you do feel something.

639
00:55:46,136 --> 00:55:48,930
I will not let you
give up your future for me.

640
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:51,266
You are asking me to be rational.

641
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:54,727
That is something I know I cannot do.

642
00:55:55,103 --> 00:55:59,441
Believe me, I wish that I could just
wish away my feelings,

643
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:01,401
but I can't.

644
00:56:03,153 --> 00:56:05,238
I will not give in to this.

645
00:56:12,203 --> 00:56:14,205
Well, you know, it...

646
00:56:14,289 --> 00:56:17,375
Wouldn't have to be that way.

647
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:20,503
We could keep it a secret.

648
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:23,882
We'd be living a lie,

649
00:56:23,965 --> 00:56:26,050
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.

650
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,304
I couldn't do that.

651
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:32,640
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

652
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:38,062
No. You're right.

653
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,357
It would destroy us.

654
00:56:48,865 --> 00:56:52,410
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

655
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:56,122
And remind them,
if they need more troops,

656
00:56:56,206 --> 00:56:59,125
it will take more time to grow them.

657
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:02,003
- I won't forget, and thank you.
- Thank you.

658
00:57:19,354 --> 00:57:21,189
R4!

659
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:24,943
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

660
00:57:31,324 --> 00:57:32,909
<i>I have successfully made contact</i>

661
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:34,577
<i>with the prime minister of Kamino.</i>

662
00:57:35,078 --> 00:57:37,330
<i>They are using a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett</i>

663
00:57:37,413 --> 00:57:38,748
<i>to create a clone army.</i>

664
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:41,167
<i>I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter</i>

665
00:57:41,251 --> 00:57:43,628
<i>is the assassin we are looking for.</i>

666
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:45,171
Do you think these cloners are involved

667
00:57:45,255 --> 00:57:47,840
in the plot to
assassinate Senator Amidala?

668
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:50,802
<i>No, Master.
There appears to be no motive.</i>

669
00:57:51,052 --> 00:57:53,888
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

670
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:56,766
Clear your mind must be

671
00:57:56,849 --> 00:58:01,229
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

672
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:02,897
<i>Yes, Master.</i>

673
00:58:02,981 --> 00:58:06,317
<i>They say Master Sifo-Dyas
placed an order for a clone army</i>

674
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:10,196
<i>at the request of the Senate
almost ten years ago.</i>

675
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:15,785
<i>I was under the impression
he was killed before that.</i>

676
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,289
<i>Did the council ever authorise
the creation of a clone army?</i>

677
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:21,291
No. Whoever placed that order

678
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:23,710
did not have the authorisation
of the Jedi Council.

679
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:28,172
Bring him here. Question him we will.

680
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:32,093
<i>Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.</i>

681
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:37,307
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army

682
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:39,267
we could not see.

683
00:58:42,687 --> 00:58:44,522
I think it is time
we informed the Senate

684
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:46,983
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

685
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:52,113
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

686
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:54,198
If informed the Senate is,

687
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:57,035
multiply our adversaries will.

688
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:01,039
No.

689
00:59:01,122 --> 00:59:03,374
- No.
<i>- Anakin! Help me!</i>

690
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:04,709
Mom, no.

691
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:07,754
<i>- Anakin!</i>
- Don't.

692
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:10,340
No.

693
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:14,636
No.

694
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:36,574
Don't go.

695
00:59:38,326 --> 00:59:40,870
I don't want to disturb you.

696
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:43,956
Your presence is soothing.

697
00:59:46,501 --> 00:59:49,003
You had another nightmare last night.

698
00:59:50,088 --> 00:59:52,590
Jedi don't have nightmares.

699
00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:54,717
I heard you.

700
00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:02,183
I saw my mother.

701
01:00:04,602 --> 01:00:07,230
She is suffering, Padmé.

702
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,694
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

703
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:25,915
She is in pain.

704
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:31,129
I know I'm disobeying
my mandate to protect you, Senator,

705
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:33,756
but I have to go.

706
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,094
I have to help her.

707
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:41,723
I'll go with you.

708
01:00:42,432 --> 01:00:44,517
I'm sorry. I don't have a choice.

709
01:00:55,445 --> 01:00:57,113
Dad, look!

710
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:00,116
Boba, get on board!

711
01:02:16,609 --> 01:02:18,194
Oh, not good.

712
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:30,618
- Wait right there.
- Okey-okey.

713
01:05:00,606 --> 01:05:02,483
Ani?

714
01:05:04,235 --> 01:05:05,736
Little Ani?

715
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,574
Ah...

716
01:05:12,493 --> 01:05:16,539
You are Ani! It is you!

717
01:05:16,622 --> 01:05:20,668
You sure sprouted, huh?

718
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:24,714
A Jedi! Whattaya know!

719
01:05:25,297 --> 01:05:30,428
Hey, maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

720
01:05:30,678 --> 01:05:32,138
My mother.

721
01:05:32,722 --> 01:05:35,683
Oh, yeah. Shmi. Uh...

722
01:05:36,684 --> 01:05:39,520
She's not mine-a no more-a. I sold her.

723
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:41,731
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

724
01:05:41,856 --> 01:05:45,735
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business, huh?

725
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:49,613
Yeah, I sold her to a moisture farmer
named Lars.

726
01:05:49,697 --> 01:05:52,033
At least I think it was Lars.

727
01:05:52,116 --> 01:05:55,619
Believe it or not,
I heard he freed her and married her!

728
01:05:55,703 --> 01:05:59,165
Can ya beat that? Yeah.

729
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:02,543
Do you know where they are now?

730
01:06:03,419 --> 01:06:05,546
Long way from here.

731
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:10,259
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

732
01:06:10,676 --> 01:06:12,428
I'd like to know.

733
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:16,640
Sure. Absolutely!

734
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:19,894
Let's go look at my records, huh?

735
01:06:48,464 --> 01:06:51,383
Dad! I think we're being tracked!

736
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:54,887
He must have put
a homing device on our hull.

737
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:57,223
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field,

738
01:06:57,723 --> 01:07:00,518
and we'll have a couple
of surprises for him.

739
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:14,865
Seismic charges! Stand by.

740
01:07:40,182 --> 01:07:42,685
He doesn't seem to take a hint,
this guy.

741
01:08:01,704 --> 01:08:02,705
Watch out!

742
01:08:22,349 --> 01:08:24,935
Get him, Dad! Get him! Fire!

743
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:29,565
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

744
01:08:49,752 --> 01:08:53,172
- We got him!
- We'll just have to finish him.

745
01:09:19,323 --> 01:09:22,618
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

746
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:28,040
Fire them now!

747
01:09:41,053 --> 01:09:43,973
Well, we won't be seeing him again.

748
01:10:18,674 --> 01:10:20,551
Well, R4, I think
we've waited long enough.

749
01:10:41,363 --> 01:10:44,950
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

750
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:22,905
Stay with the ship, R2.

751
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,377
Oh.

752
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:41,757
Hello. How might I be of service?
I am C...

753
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,384
3PO?

754
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:47,513
The maker!

755
01:11:47,596 --> 01:11:50,641
Master Ani! I knew you would return.

756
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:54,144
I knew it! And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

757
01:11:54,228 --> 01:11:55,604
Hello, 3PO.

758
01:11:56,188 --> 01:11:59,691
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

759
01:12:00,067 --> 01:12:01,568
I've come to see my mother.

760
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,320
Oh.

761
01:12:03,404 --> 01:12:06,156
I think perhaps we'd better go indoors.

762
01:12:08,367 --> 01:12:13,122
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

763
01:12:13,205 --> 01:12:15,457
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

764
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:20,129
Owen Lars. This is my girlfriend, Beru.

765
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:23,048
- Hello.
- I'm Padmé.

766
01:12:23,132 --> 01:12:25,384
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

767
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:28,387
I had a feeling you
might show up someday.

768
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:32,975
- Is my mother here?
- No, she's not.

769
01:12:33,976 --> 01:12:37,020
Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife.

770
01:12:38,856 --> 01:12:42,151
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

771
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:52,828
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

772
01:12:52,911 --> 01:12:56,707
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.

773
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:59,793
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did,

774
01:12:59,877 --> 01:13:03,380
to pick mushrooms
that grow on the vaporators.

775
01:13:03,464 --> 01:13:08,135
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home

776
01:13:08,218 --> 01:13:09,344
when they took her.

777
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:12,973
Those Tuskens walk like men,

778
01:13:13,056 --> 01:13:17,853
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

779
01:13:19,271 --> 01:13:22,691
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

780
01:13:23,442 --> 01:13:27,821
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg,

781
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:33,452
I just couldn't ride
anymore until I heal.

782
01:13:34,161 --> 01:13:36,288
I don't want to give up on her,

783
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:39,208
but she's been gone a month.

784
01:13:40,334 --> 01:13:43,420
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.

785
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:49,259
Where are you going?

786
01:13:49,343 --> 01:13:51,386
To find my mother.

787
01:13:52,888 --> 01:13:56,183
Your mother's dead, son. Accept it.

788
01:14:17,829 --> 01:14:20,082
You're gonna have to stay here.

789
01:14:20,832 --> 01:14:24,169
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.

790
01:14:24,253 --> 01:14:25,420
Anakin...

791
01:14:36,223 --> 01:14:38,267
I won't be long.

792
01:16:27,376 --> 01:16:29,336
We must persuade
the Commerce Guild

793
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:31,672
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

794
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:35,300
What about
the senator from Naboo?

795
01:16:35,384 --> 01:16:37,844
Is she dead yet?

796
01:16:37,928 --> 01:16:41,682
I am not signing your treaty until
I have her head on my desk.

797
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:44,351
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

798
01:16:44,434 --> 01:16:47,646
With these new battle droids
we've built for you,

799
01:16:47,729 --> 01:16:50,941
you'll have the finest
army in the galaxy.

800
01:17:01,535 --> 01:17:03,203
As I explained to you earlier,

801
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:07,207
I am quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems

802
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,626
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

803
01:17:14,423 --> 01:17:19,886
The Techno Union army...

804
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:22,389
...is at your disposal, Count.

805
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:26,977
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

806
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,729
Good. Very good.

807
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:33,358
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support,

808
01:17:33,442 --> 01:17:36,278
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours,

809
01:17:36,361 --> 01:17:40,240
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

810
01:17:40,323 --> 01:17:44,202
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.

811
01:17:44,411 --> 01:17:48,457
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

812
01:18:47,098 --> 01:18:48,725
Mom.

813
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:50,852
Mom? Mom?

814
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:54,898
Ani?

815
01:18:56,399 --> 01:19:00,779
Ani? Is it you?

816
01:19:01,363 --> 01:19:05,116
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

817
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:07,994
Ani?

818
01:19:08,787 --> 01:19:10,789
Ani?

819
01:19:12,082 --> 01:19:14,251
You look so handsome.

820
01:19:17,546 --> 01:19:19,756
My son.

821
01:19:20,507 --> 01:19:23,093
My grown-up son.

822
01:19:23,802 --> 01:19:26,471
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

823
01:19:26,888 --> 01:19:28,848
I missed you.

824
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:33,436
Now I am complete.

825
01:19:38,942 --> 01:19:42,487
I love y...

826
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,408
Stay with me, Mom. Everything...

827
01:19:46,491 --> 01:19:48,618
I love...

828
01:19:50,036 --> 01:19:52,831
I... I love...

829
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:54,559
<i>Anakin! Anakin! No!</i>

830
01:21:14,829 --> 01:21:16,039
What is it?

831
01:21:16,748 --> 01:21:20,710
Pain, suffering,

832
01:21:20,794 --> 01:21:23,171
death I feel.

833
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:31,429
Something terrible has happened.

834
01:21:33,348 --> 01:21:38,269
Young Skywalker is in pain.
Terrible pain.

835
01:21:43,608 --> 01:21:46,569
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

836
01:21:46,653 --> 01:21:49,656
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

837
01:21:51,241 --> 01:21:53,410
We'll have to try something else.

838
01:21:55,870 --> 01:22:01,000
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo. It's much closer.

839
01:22:03,044 --> 01:22:05,255
Anakin? Anakin, do you copy?

840
01:22:05,338 --> 01:22:08,299
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

841
01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:10,677
He's not on Naboo, R4.

842
01:22:12,804 --> 01:22:14,806
I'm going to try and widen the range.

843
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:19,728
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

844
01:22:27,277 --> 01:22:29,195
That's Anakin's tracking signal,
all right,

845
01:22:29,988 --> 01:22:33,199
but it's coming from Tatooine.

846
01:22:33,283 --> 01:22:35,702
What in the blazes is he doing there?

847
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:37,746
I told him to stay on Naboo.

848
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:42,917
We haven't got much time.

849
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:45,462
Anakin? Anakin, do you copy?

850
01:22:45,545 --> 01:22:47,630
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

851
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,474
<i>Retransmit this message...</i>

852
01:22:59,267 --> 01:23:02,187
<i>Anakin, do you copy? Anakin...</i>

853
01:23:02,562 --> 01:23:04,522
<i>My long-range has been knocked out.</i>

854
01:23:04,606 --> 01:23:06,858
<i>Retransmit this message to Coruscant.</i>

855
01:23:51,236 --> 01:23:53,738
I brought you something.

856
01:23:54,113 --> 01:23:55,949
Are you hungry?

857
01:23:57,534 --> 01:23:59,536
The shifter broke.

858
01:24:01,538 --> 01:24:04,833
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

859
01:24:06,835 --> 01:24:10,380
I'm good at fixing things. Always was.

860
01:24:12,674 --> 01:24:14,676
But I couldn't...

861
01:24:18,429 --> 01:24:20,682
Why'd she have to die?

862
01:24:23,768 --> 01:24:25,770
Why couldn't I save her?

863
01:24:25,854 --> 01:24:27,939
I know I could have!

864
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,653
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.

865
01:24:34,863 --> 01:24:38,074
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

866
01:24:40,618 --> 01:24:42,787
Someday I will be.

867
01:24:42,871 --> 01:24:45,915
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever!

868
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,168
I promise you.

869
01:24:49,961 --> 01:24:52,547
I will even learn to
stop people from dying.

870
01:24:53,423 --> 01:24:54,757
Anakin.

871
01:24:56,009 --> 01:24:58,803
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!

872
01:24:58,887 --> 01:25:01,931
He's jealous! He's holding me back!

873
01:25:06,603 --> 01:25:08,897
What's wrong, Ani?

874
01:25:14,027 --> 01:25:16,195
I...

875
01:25:19,449 --> 01:25:21,618
I killed them.

876
01:25:22,869 --> 01:25:24,996
I killed them all.

877
01:25:26,915 --> 01:25:29,000
They're dead.

878
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:31,461
Every single one of them.

879
01:25:33,087 --> 01:25:35,214
And not just the men,

880
01:25:36,966 --> 01:25:39,177
but the women

881
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:41,304
and the children too.

882
01:25:43,014 --> 01:25:46,976
They're like animals,
and I slaughtered them like animals!

883
01:25:48,311 --> 01:25:50,355
I hate them!

884
01:26:08,081 --> 01:26:10,166
To be angry is to be human.

885
01:26:10,959 --> 01:26:12,961
I'm a Jedi.

886
01:26:13,044 --> 01:26:15,213
I know I'm better than this.

887
01:26:28,977 --> 01:26:33,815
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.

888
01:26:33,898 --> 01:26:38,903
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

889
01:26:41,781 --> 01:26:43,992
Good-bye, my darling wife.

890
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:49,956
And thank you.

891
01:27:17,108 --> 01:27:20,028
I wasn't strong enough
to save you, Mom.

892
01:27:22,488 --> 01:27:24,032
I wasn't strong enough.

893
01:27:28,286 --> 01:27:32,123
But I promise I won't fail again.

894
01:27:42,717 --> 01:27:44,886
I miss you...

895
01:27:46,345 --> 01:27:47,930
So much.

896
01:27:55,313 --> 01:27:57,774
R2? What are you doing here?

897
01:28:00,234 --> 01:28:04,864
It seems that he is carrying a message
from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

898
01:28:05,531 --> 01:28:09,160
Master Ani,
does that name mean anything to you?

899
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:13,831
<i>Anakin, my long-range
transmitter has been knocked out.</i>

900
01:28:13,915 --> 01:28:16,167
<i>Retransmit this message to Coruscant.</i>

901
01:28:20,254 --> 01:28:22,548
<i>I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett,</i>

902
01:28:22,632 --> 01:28:25,051
<i>to the droid foundries on Geonosis.</i>

903
01:28:25,134 --> 01:28:28,429
<i>The Trade Federation is to take
delivery of a droid army here,</i>

904
01:28:28,513 --> 01:28:30,848
<i>and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray</i>

905
01:28:30,932 --> 01:28:34,393
<i>is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.</i>

906
01:28:34,477 --> 01:28:36,312
<i>The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance</i>

907
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:40,066
<i>have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming a...</i>

908
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:42,401
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

909
01:28:53,704 --> 01:28:58,042
More happening on Geonosis,
I feel, than has been revealed.

910
01:28:58,126 --> 01:29:00,044
I agree.

911
01:29:00,128 --> 01:29:03,256
Anakin, we will deal with Count Dooku.

912
01:29:03,339 --> 01:29:07,260
<i>The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.</i>

913
01:29:07,593 --> 01:29:10,012
<i>Protect the senator at all costs.</i>

914
01:29:10,304 --> 01:29:13,224
<i>That is your first priority.</i>

915
01:29:14,183 --> 01:29:16,144
Understood, Master.

916
01:29:16,227 --> 01:29:17,645
They'll never get there in time
to save him.

917
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:21,607
They have to come
halfway across the galaxy. Look.

918
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:25,945
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

919
01:29:26,237 --> 01:29:28,281
If he's still alive.

920
01:29:29,657 --> 01:29:32,118
Ani, are you just
gonna sit here and let him die?

921
01:29:32,201 --> 01:29:33,786
He's your friend, your mentor. He's...

922
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:35,037
He's like my father!

923
01:29:36,205 --> 01:29:40,126
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here!

924
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:43,171
He gave you strict orders to protect me,

925
01:29:43,254 --> 01:29:45,798
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

926
01:29:46,924 --> 01:29:50,344
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

927
01:29:54,265 --> 01:29:58,144
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

928
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:09,572
The Commerce Guilds
are preparing for war.

929
01:30:09,655 --> 01:30:10,948
There can be no doubt of that.

930
01:30:11,032 --> 01:30:12,867
Count Dooku
must have made a treaty with them.

931
01:30:19,415 --> 01:30:22,627
Unfortunately, the debate is not over.

932
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:27,048
The Senate will never approve the use
of clones before the separatists attack.

933
01:30:27,131 --> 01:30:28,841
This is a crisis.

934
01:30:28,925 --> 01:30:31,928
The Senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

935
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:35,765
He can then approve
the creation of an army.

936
01:30:35,848 --> 01:30:38,142
But what senator
would have the courage

937
01:30:38,225 --> 01:30:40,728
to propose such a radical amendment?

938
01:30:41,145 --> 01:30:45,316
If only Senator Amidala were here.

939
01:30:46,567 --> 01:30:47,652
Hmm.

940
01:31:06,212 --> 01:31:07,797
Traitor.

941
01:31:08,673 --> 01:31:12,051
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

942
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:14,136
They have gone too far.
This is madness.

943
01:31:14,303 --> 01:31:16,764
I thought you were the leader here,
Dooku.

944
01:31:17,181 --> 01:31:19,475
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.

945
01:31:20,059 --> 01:31:22,979
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

946
01:31:23,062 --> 01:31:26,649
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

947
01:31:27,233 --> 01:31:30,695
May I ask why a Jedi knight

948
01:31:30,778 --> 01:31:33,155
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

949
01:31:33,739 --> 01:31:36,158
I've been tracking
a bounty hunter named Jango Fett.

950
01:31:36,242 --> 01:31:37,785
Do you know him?

951
01:31:37,868 --> 01:31:40,788
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

952
01:31:40,871 --> 01:31:42,623
The Geonosians don't trust them.

953
01:31:42,707 --> 01:31:45,918
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

954
01:31:46,961 --> 01:31:51,465
It's a great pity that our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

955
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:54,719
Qui-Gon always
spoke very highly of you.

956
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:01,475
I wish he were still alive.

957
01:32:02,727 --> 01:32:05,312
I could use his help right now.

958
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:08,190
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

959
01:32:10,276 --> 01:32:13,154
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

960
01:32:13,237 --> 01:32:16,282
You forget that he was once
my apprentice,

961
01:32:16,365 --> 01:32:18,576
just as you were once his.

962
01:32:19,326 --> 01:32:21,287
He knew all about
the corruption in the Senate,

963
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:22,830
but he would never
have gone along with it

964
01:32:22,913 --> 01:32:24,623
if he had learned the truth as I have.

965
01:32:24,915 --> 01:32:27,418
- The truth?
- The truth.

966
01:32:33,841 --> 01:32:35,301
What if I told you that the Republic

967
01:32:35,384 --> 01:32:38,929
was now under the control
of the dark lord of the Sith?

968
01:32:39,013 --> 01:32:42,308
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

969
01:32:42,767 --> 01:32:47,396
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

970
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:50,316
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence

971
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:54,779
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

972
01:32:55,821 --> 01:32:57,740
I don't believe you.

973
01:32:57,823 --> 01:32:59,867
The viceroy of the Trade Federation

974
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:04,371
was once in league
with this Darth Sidious,

975
01:33:04,622 --> 01:33:08,334
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

976
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:11,462
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

977
01:33:13,339 --> 01:33:16,008
You must join me, Obi-Wan,

978
01:33:16,467 --> 01:33:20,763
and together we will destroy the Sith!

979
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:24,934
I will never join you, Dooku.

980
01:33:34,193 --> 01:33:37,238
It may be difficult
to secure your release.

981
01:33:44,829 --> 01:33:47,998
It's-a clear desa
separatists made a pact

982
01:33:48,082 --> 01:33:50,376
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

983
01:33:50,459 --> 01:33:54,797
Senators, dellow felagates...

984
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:59,385
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic,

985
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:03,139
mesa propose that the Senate

986
01:34:03,305 --> 01:34:06,475
give immediately emergency powers

987
01:34:06,559 --> 01:34:09,520
to the supreme chancellor.

988
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:15,776
Palpatine! Palpatine! Palpatine!

989
01:34:19,029 --> 01:34:22,324
Order! We shall have order!

990
01:34:23,659 --> 01:34:26,829
It is with great reluctance

991
01:34:26,912 --> 01:34:29,415
that I have agreed to this calling.

992
01:34:30,457 --> 01:34:34,628
I love democracy. I love the Republic.

993
01:34:36,046 --> 01:34:37,756
The power you give me,

994
01:34:37,965 --> 01:34:42,469
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.

995
01:34:47,183 --> 01:34:51,478
And as my first act
with this new authority,

996
01:34:52,104 --> 01:34:56,233
I will create a grand army
of the Republic

997
01:34:56,901 --> 01:35:00,738
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

998
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,991
- It is done, then.
- Hmm.

999
01:35:08,454 --> 01:35:12,374
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

1000
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:17,379
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino,

1001
01:35:17,463 --> 01:35:21,300
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

1002
01:35:41,445 --> 01:35:43,656
See those columns
of steam straight ahead?

1003
01:35:43,739 --> 01:35:45,783
They're exhaust vents of some type.

1004
01:35:46,492 --> 01:35:48,077
That'll do.

1005
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,215
Look, whatever happens out there,
follow my lead.

1006
01:36:01,298 --> 01:36:03,509
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.

1007
01:36:03,592 --> 01:36:04,677
As a member of the Senate,

1008
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:07,596
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

1009
01:36:08,514 --> 01:36:12,518
Don't worry.
I've given up trying to argue with you.

1010
01:36:18,065 --> 01:36:21,151
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help,

1011
01:36:21,235 --> 01:36:23,237
they would have asked for it.

1012
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:26,573
You obviously have a great deal to learn
about human behaviour.

1013
01:36:52,391 --> 01:36:53,392
For a mechanic,

1014
01:36:53,475 --> 01:36:55,561
you seem to do an excessive
amount of thinking.

1015
01:36:57,688 --> 01:37:00,232
I am programmed
to understand humans!

1016
01:37:03,777 --> 01:37:05,529
"What does that mean?"

1017
01:37:05,612 --> 01:37:08,532
That means I am in charge here!

1018
01:37:08,615 --> 01:37:11,618
Where are you going now?
You don't know what's out there.

1019
01:37:11,702 --> 01:37:15,205
Have you no sense at all? Idiot!

1020
01:37:17,875 --> 01:37:19,585
Please wait.

1021
01:37:20,627 --> 01:37:22,421
Do you know where you're going?

1022
01:37:34,767 --> 01:37:36,435
Wait.

1023
01:37:45,277 --> 01:37:47,154
Oh, my...

1024
01:37:57,581 --> 01:37:59,291
Padmé!

1025
01:38:52,219 --> 01:38:55,848
Oh, my goodness! Shut me down!

1026
01:38:56,682 --> 01:38:58,684
Machines making machines.

1027
01:38:59,643 --> 01:39:00,978
How perverse. Oh!

1028
01:39:01,979 --> 01:39:05,399
Calm down, R2. I almost fell.

1029
01:39:05,607 --> 01:39:07,317
You'll get your chance...

1030
01:39:09,736 --> 01:39:11,280
I'm scrap.

1031
01:39:12,698 --> 01:39:14,658
It's a nightmare!

1032
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:18,620
I want to go home!

1033
01:39:20,622 --> 01:39:22,124
What did I do to deserve this?

1034
01:40:01,872 --> 01:40:04,249
I wonder what happened
to poor little R2.

1035
01:40:04,583 --> 01:40:06,668
He's always getting
himself into trouble.

1036
01:40:08,378 --> 01:40:09,671
Oh, no!

1037
01:40:19,515 --> 01:40:20,516
Uh-oh.

1038
01:40:24,853 --> 01:40:26,480
I'm so confused.

1039
01:42:22,262 --> 01:42:23,805
Not again.

1040
01:42:24,681 --> 01:42:26,391
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1041
01:42:35,317 --> 01:42:38,487
Don't move, Jedi! Take him away.

1042
01:42:57,881 --> 01:42:59,508
Don't be afraid.

1043
01:43:00,884 --> 01:43:03,261
I'm not afraid to die.

1044
01:43:07,974 --> 01:43:12,145
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

1045
01:43:13,730 --> 01:43:15,899
What are you talking about?

1046
01:43:17,150 --> 01:43:19,653
I love you.

1047
01:43:23,281 --> 01:43:25,283
You love me?

1048
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:33,125
I thought that we had decided
not to fall in love,

1049
01:43:34,876 --> 01:43:38,630
that we would be forced to live a lie

1050
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,800
and that it would destroy our lives.

1051
01:43:42,384 --> 01:43:45,470
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

1052
01:43:49,766 --> 01:43:51,351
I truly,

1053
01:43:52,728 --> 01:43:55,689
deeply love you,

1054
01:43:56,773 --> 01:43:59,901
and before we die, I want you to know.

1055
01:44:56,458 --> 01:44:58,919
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

1056
01:44:59,002 --> 01:45:02,589
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

1057
01:45:04,257 --> 01:45:06,176
Then we decided to come
and rescue you.

1058
01:45:07,636 --> 01:45:08,887
Good job.

1059
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:07,571
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1060
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:35,432
- Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?

1061
01:46:35,849 --> 01:46:37,767
She seems to be on top of things.

1062
01:47:40,997 --> 01:47:44,501
She can't do that!
Shoot her or something!

1063
01:49:03,913 --> 01:49:04,956
Jump!

1064
01:49:10,587 --> 01:49:11,588
Hyah!

1065
01:49:29,189 --> 01:49:34,402
This isn't how it's supposed to be!
Jango! Finish her off!

1066
01:49:34,652 --> 01:49:38,907
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.

1067
01:50:08,394 --> 01:50:12,482
Master Windu,
how pleasant of you to join us.

1068
01:50:12,565 --> 01:50:14,442
This party's over.

1069
01:50:28,456 --> 01:50:33,128
Brave but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1070
01:50:33,211 --> 01:50:37,298
- You're impossibly outnumbered.
- I don't think so.

1071
01:50:37,715 --> 01:50:38,758
We'll see.

1072
01:51:17,338 --> 01:51:20,091
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

1073
01:51:59,464 --> 01:52:02,258
What's all this noise? A battle!

1074
01:52:02,467 --> 01:52:04,469
There's been some terrible mistake!

1075
01:52:04,552 --> 01:52:07,347
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!

1076
01:53:35,393 --> 01:53:38,563
Die, Jedi dogs! What did I say?

1077
01:53:48,156 --> 01:53:51,075
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1078
01:53:56,789 --> 01:53:59,625
Excuse me. I'm trapped. I can't get up.

1079
01:54:13,681 --> 01:54:15,350
You call this a diplomatic solution?

1080
01:54:15,433 --> 01:54:17,602
No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1081
01:54:22,648 --> 01:54:23,649
Uh-oh.

1082
01:54:23,733 --> 01:54:24,859
Roger, roger.

1083
01:54:43,461 --> 01:54:45,213
R2, what are you doing here?

1084
01:54:48,549 --> 01:54:50,968
What are you doing? Stop that!

1085
01:54:51,052 --> 01:54:53,763
You're going to strain something.
My neck!

1086
01:54:56,599 --> 01:54:59,644
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag.

1087
01:55:05,316 --> 01:55:06,609
I'm quite beside myself.

1088
01:55:15,743 --> 01:55:18,663
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

1089
01:55:20,123 --> 01:55:22,750
Yes, but is my head on straight?

1090
01:55:45,398 --> 01:55:49,360
Master Windu,
you have fought gallantly,

1091
01:55:50,445 --> 01:55:55,700
worthy of recognition
in the archives of the Jedi order.

1092
01:55:56,701 --> 01:56:00,037
Now it is finished.

1093
01:56:01,706 --> 01:56:06,085
Surrender,
and your lives will be spared.

1094
01:56:06,627 --> 01:56:10,548
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

1095
01:56:10,631 --> 01:56:14,802
Then, I'm sorry, old friend.

1096
01:56:26,439 --> 01:56:27,857
Look!

1097
01:56:38,493 --> 01:56:42,872
Around the survivors
a perimeter create.

1098
01:57:39,303 --> 01:57:42,473
I've had the most peculiar dream.

1099
01:57:53,067 --> 01:57:54,944
If Dooku escapes,

1100
01:57:55,361 --> 01:57:58,781
rally more systems to his cause he will.

1101
01:58:03,578 --> 01:58:04,870
Hold on!

1102
01:58:09,959 --> 01:58:11,919
Aim right above the fuel cells!

1103
01:58:18,759 --> 01:58:21,012
Good call, my young Padawan.

1104
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:36,819
The Jedi have
amassed a huge army.

1105
01:58:37,153 --> 01:58:38,988
That doesn't seem possible.

1106
01:58:39,071 --> 01:58:41,699
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?

1107
01:58:41,782 --> 01:58:45,828
We must send
all available droids into battle.

1108
01:58:45,911 --> 01:58:47,163
There are too many.

1109
01:58:59,091 --> 01:59:02,136
- Pilot, land in that assembly area!
- Yes, sir.

1110
01:59:11,896 --> 01:59:15,691
Sir, I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

1111
01:59:17,068 --> 01:59:20,654
To the forward
command centre take me.

1112
01:59:43,719 --> 01:59:46,055
Attack those Federation starships!
Quickly!

1113
01:59:57,149 --> 02:00:00,945
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

1114
02:00:01,362 --> 02:00:05,408
Very good. Very good.

1115
02:00:33,144 --> 02:00:35,521
This is not looking good at all!

1116
02:00:36,981 --> 02:00:40,276
We must get the starships
back into space.

1117
02:00:47,408 --> 02:00:49,118
My master will never allow the Republic

1118
02:00:49,201 --> 02:00:50,536
to get away with this treachery.

1119
02:01:10,139 --> 02:01:12,516
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

1120
02:01:13,642 --> 02:01:17,062
They will be much safer there
with my master.

1121
02:02:11,242 --> 02:02:15,412
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

1122
02:02:16,163 --> 02:02:17,373
Yes, sir.

1123
02:02:18,249 --> 02:02:21,001
Move all quadrants to sector 5-1-5.

1124
02:03:02,001 --> 02:03:03,002
Look over there!

1125
02:03:06,422 --> 02:03:08,674
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1126
02:03:09,258 --> 02:03:10,884
We're out of rockets, sir.

1127
02:03:11,093 --> 02:03:13,804
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

1128
02:03:13,887 --> 02:03:17,808
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1129
02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:38,287
Padmé!

1130
02:03:41,749 --> 02:03:44,126
- Put the ship down!
- Anakin!

1131
02:03:44,209 --> 02:03:48,005
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way! Follow that speeder!

1132
02:03:54,053 --> 02:03:56,180
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1133
02:03:56,263 --> 02:03:59,975
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1134
02:04:00,309 --> 02:04:03,103
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1135
02:04:03,187 --> 02:04:05,397
You will be expelled
from the Jedi order!

1136
02:04:05,481 --> 02:04:08,359
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

1137
02:04:08,442 --> 02:04:11,362
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

1138
02:04:16,033 --> 02:04:17,409
She would do her duty.

1139
02:04:27,044 --> 02:04:29,088
The droid army is in full retreat.

1140
02:04:29,171 --> 02:04:32,299
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.

1141
02:04:59,326 --> 02:05:02,287
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

1142
02:05:02,705 --> 02:05:04,331
We'll take him together.
Go in slowly on the left.

1143
02:05:04,415 --> 02:05:05,499
I'm taking him now!

1144
02:05:05,582 --> 02:05:08,001
No, Anakin! No! No!

1145
02:05:14,216 --> 02:05:17,970
As you see,
my Jedi powers are far beyond yours.

1146
02:05:18,053 --> 02:05:20,556
Now back down.

1147
02:05:25,853 --> 02:05:27,688
I don't think so.

1148
02:05:40,534 --> 02:05:43,245
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1149
02:05:43,328 --> 02:05:46,457
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1150
02:05:50,002 --> 02:05:51,211
Surely you can do better.

1151
02:06:02,389 --> 02:06:05,017
- Are you all right?
- Uh-huh.

1152
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:09,104
We'd better get back
to the forward command centre.

1153
02:06:09,188 --> 02:06:10,814
No. No.

1154
02:06:11,356 --> 02:06:14,318
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1155
02:06:14,401 --> 02:06:17,571
- Get a transport. Hurry!
- Right away.

1156
02:06:43,388 --> 02:06:44,640
Brave of you, boy.

1157
02:06:46,266 --> 02:06:48,310
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

1158
02:06:48,393 --> 02:06:50,687
- I am a slow learner.
- Anakin!

1159
02:07:52,583 --> 02:07:57,170
- Master Yoda.
- Count Dooku.

1160
02:07:57,546 --> 02:08:00,924
You have interfered
with our affairs for the last time.

1161
02:08:31,455 --> 02:08:35,000
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1162
02:08:35,334 --> 02:08:38,503
The dark side I sense in you.

1163
02:08:38,837 --> 02:08:41,715
I've become more powerful
than any Jedi.

1164
02:08:43,592 --> 02:08:44,843
Even you.

1165
02:08:59,399 --> 02:09:02,527
Much to learn you still have.

1166
02:09:03,153 --> 02:09:05,989
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided

1167
02:09:06,073 --> 02:09:09,284
by our knowledge of the Force...

1168
02:09:09,993 --> 02:09:12,829
...but by our skills with a lightsabre.

1169
02:09:54,413 --> 02:09:57,833
Fought well you have, my old Padawan.

1170
02:09:58,041 --> 02:09:59,876
This is just the beginning.

1171
02:11:14,659 --> 02:11:16,453
Anakin!

1172
02:12:32,696 --> 02:12:35,615
The Force is with us,
Master Sidious.

1173
02:12:35,699 --> 02:12:38,577
Welcome home,
Lord Tyranus.

1174
02:12:40,328 --> 02:12:42,873
You have done well.

1175
02:12:42,956 --> 02:12:45,000
I have good news for you, my lord.

1176
02:12:46,668 --> 02:12:50,046
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

1177
02:12:50,130 --> 02:12:52,841
Everything is going as planned.

1178
02:13:03,018 --> 02:13:04,603
Do you believe what
Count Dooku said

1179
02:13:04,686 --> 02:13:07,439
about Sidious controlling the Senate?

1180
02:13:07,522 --> 02:13:09,691
It doesn't feel right.

1181
02:13:09,774 --> 02:13:12,819
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1182
02:13:14,237 --> 02:13:15,822
Lies, deceit,

1183
02:13:16,323 --> 02:13:19,659
creating mistrust are his ways now.

1184
02:13:19,743 --> 02:13:24,372
Nevertheless, I feel we should
keep a closer eye on the Senate.

1185
02:13:24,456 --> 02:13:26,499
I agree.

1186
02:13:27,751 --> 02:13:29,753
Where is your apprentice?

1187
02:13:29,961 --> 02:13:33,882
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1188
02:13:35,300 --> 02:13:38,678
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

1189
02:13:38,762 --> 02:13:40,847
Victory?

1190
02:13:41,765 --> 02:13:44,351
Victory, you say?

1191
02:13:44,434 --> 02:13:48,188
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.

1192
02:13:49,689 --> 02:13:53,026
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

1193
02:13:54,611 --> 02:13:58,698
Begun the Clone War has.
